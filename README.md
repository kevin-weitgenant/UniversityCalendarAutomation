 Simple web app for automatizing the creation of calendars for myself and students of my college(UFPEL), it's possible to generate a ".ical" file or get the calendar directly in Google Calendar. The project was shared in the UFPEL Facebook group and was well received.

For next semester I would like to develop APIs that the college website can use and then it would be even easier for students to create their calendars and keep organized because there would be no need to copy their classes schedules and go to my web app, because directly in the college website the calendars would be generated.
